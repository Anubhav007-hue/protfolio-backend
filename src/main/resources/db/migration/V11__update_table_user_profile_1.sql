    bio = 'As a results-driven Full-Stack Software Engineer with over 3 years of experience, I am passionate about building robust, scalable systems that bridge the gap between powerful backend logic and intuitive user experiences. My expertise lies in crafting efficient APIs and microservices, alongside a keen interest in modern front-end frameworks like HTML, and aspiring to integrate Angular for dynamic user interfaces.

Throughout my career, I have specialized in backend development, adept at leveraging Spring Boot, Microservices, and Spring Batch to create high-performing solutions. I am proficient in database technologies including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and YUGABYTE, with a proven track record of delivering projects on time with a 100% First Time Right (FTR) rate. My experience spans the full development lifecycle, from optimizing system performance and troubleshooting to orchestrating complex API integrations and designing risk management modules.

In previous roles, I have had the opportunity to develop and test application procedures, provide critical software and hardware troubleshooting, and engineer secure login portals, significantly enhancing system security and efficiency. My work includes building advanced functionalities like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems, PDF generators, and automated document scanning processes, demonstrating a commitment to optimizing workflows and reducing manual intervention.

Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active, exploring new technologies, and continuously learning.',
